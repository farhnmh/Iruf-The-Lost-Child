## Gameplay
#### 1. Core Mechanic
Both characters in this game have the same skill, where they can fire projectiles at each character. Projectiles in this game are not only projectiles from handguns, they can also be from energy balls and so on. There is one advantage that the boss has as an enemy, namely the bullet-hell skill, where the boss can fire a lot of projectiles in one shot. However, players will still be able to beat him if they can read the pattern of resistance given by the boss. In addition, players will also be given additional skills in the form of dashes, to speed up the movement of players.

#### 2. Game Rules
- If the player dies, then the condition of the player loses
- If the boss dies, then the player's condition wins
- If the player/boss is hit by a projectile from each enemy. So their blood is reduced
- When the boss uses the bullet-hell skill, and the player uses the dash skill to pass it, the player will not take any damage at all
